# BarHopper

BarHopper was a cross-platform product for bar owners to advertise their promotions using a web dashboard, and for bar-goers to view promotions near their location using the Android and iOS apps. 

The web dashboard is a portal for bar owners to manage their promotions. It is built with React and formerly deployed to Heroku via Git web hook to this repo. 

Both the web dashboard and user apps consume the [BarHopper API](https://github.com/burkeboston1/barhopperapi), written in Express.js on Node with a MongoDB No-SQL database.
